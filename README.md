# Potato_Disease_Classification
It is a deep learning project on agriculture domain. Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. We will use image classification using CNN and built a website using which a farmer can take a picture and website will tell you if the plant has a disease or not. Technology stack for this project will be,

Model Building: tensorflow, CNN, data augmentation, tf dataset
Backend Server and ML Ops: tf serving, FastAPI
Model Optimization: Quantization, Tensorflow lite
Frontend: React JS
